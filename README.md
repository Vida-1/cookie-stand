# Code 201 LAB - 06

## Cookie-stand
I built an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

### Reflections and Comments
* How did this go, overall?
4/11/2022: I've spent over an hour just reading through the specs and initial setup documentation then another chunk of time breaking the project down and planning out the work. I was not expecting this much of a time sink on the front end but hopefully it pays off with things progressing more smoothly tomorrow.

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?
4/11/2022: I don't yet have any observations or questions, I've just not gotten far enough into the project for that yet at this point but I'll revisit the question when I re-submit.

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
4/11/2022: This project is far from complete; hopefully I'll get some more of it done in the morning before class. I'll revisit the question upon re-submitting.
